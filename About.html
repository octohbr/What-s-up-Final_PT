                <h3>
                    This website is called “What's up?” because when we look up, there's always something to see — 
                    clouds, skies, birds, planes, even the galaxy at night. The title is playful, like asking a friend 
                    “what's up?”, but it also literally means what's up there in the sky. It's a mix of curiosity and 
                    everyday wonder, which is exactly what this site is all about: appreciating the things above us that we sometimes 
                    take for granted.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    This website was created out of my fascination with the skies above us. Whether 
                    it's the soft clouds drifting lazily, the vibrant hues of a sunset, or the endless mystery of the 
                    galaxy, the sky has always been something that captures my attention.
                    The purpose of this site is to share that wonder — to explore the 
                    different types of clouds, the ever-changing colors of the sky, and the beauty of the stars 
                    and galaxies. Here, you'll find simple explanations, fun facts, and little details that make 
                    looking up at the sky even more interesting.
                </h3>
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: -90px; padding-bottom: 25px;">
                    This isn't just about science, but also about appreciation. The sky is like a canvas that changes 
                    every day, and through this website, I hope to help others notice it in ways they may not have before.

                    So take a moment, look up, and join me in discovering the beauty of the world above us.
                </h3>
