        <h1>The Clouds</h1>
        <h3>
        Up in the sky we see different types of clouds, and we wonder how they are formed. 
        Why are the clouds like this? Why do they look that way? What makes them different from each other? 
        Questions like these pop in my mind every time I look up at the sky and notice all these clouds that 
        cover the earth. On this page, we'll see the different types of clouds, fun facts about them, and 
        how they are formed.

                <div>
                    <h2>Cumulus Cloud</h2>
                    <p>Cumulus clouds are the fluffy, white clouds we often imagine when we think of a 
                    “classic” cloud. They usually have a flat base and a puffy, rounded top, like 
                    cotton balls floating in the sky. These clouds form when warm air rises, cools, 
                    and condenses into tiny water droplets. Most cumulus clouds appear on sunny days 
                    and are a sign of fair weather, but if they grow taller and larger, they can turn 
                    into cumulonimbus clouds, which may bring rain or storms.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Nimbus/Cumulunimbus Cloud</h2>
                    <p>Cumulonimbus clouds are towering, dark clouds that bring thunderstorms, 
                    heavy rain, and sometimes even hail. They form when warm, moist air rises 
                    quickly and condenses into thick, vertical clouds that can stretch high into the sky. 
                    These clouds are powerful and impressive, signaling stormy weather, and they often 
                    appear after cumulus clouds grow very tall. Watching them can be both exciting and a 
                    little intimidating, as they are the clouds that produce dramatic lightning and thunder.</p>

                    <h2>Stratus Cloud</h2>
                    <p>Stratus clouds form in uniform, gray layers that often cover the entire sky like a blanket. 
                    They sit low in the atmosphere and can make the day feel gloomy or overcast. These clouds usually 
                    bring light rain, drizzle, or mist, but rarely storms. They form when a large mass of air is cooled 
                    evenly, causing water droplets to spread out in a continuous layer.</p>

                    <h2>Stratocumulus Cloud</h2>
                    <p>Stratocumulus clouds are low, lumpy clouds that cover the sky in patches,
                        sometimes leaving small gaps of blue. They are a mix between stratus and 
                        cumulus clouds and usually bring mild weather, though they can produce light 
                        drizzle. Their soft, rolling appearance makes them less threatening than dark 
                        storm clouds.</p>

                    <h2>Altostratus Cloud</h2>
                    <p>Altostratus clouds form in mid-altitudes as gray or bluish layers that 
                        often cover the whole sky. They are thinner than stratus clouds but can 
                        still block the sun, creating a dull, diffuse light. Altostratus clouds 
                        usually bring steady rain or snow and form when large air masses cool evenly 
                        in the middle levels of the atmosphere.</p>

                    <h2>Altocumulus Cloud</h2>
                    <p>Altocumulus clouds are mid-altitude, white or gray clouds that appear as 
                        rounded clumps or ripples in the sky. They often signal that the weather might 
                        change later in the day. These clouds form when rising air currents in the middle 
                        atmosphere cool and condense, creating a patchy, soft texture.</p>

                    <h2>Cirrus Cloud</h2>
                    <p>Cirrus clouds are thin, wispy clouds that appear very high in the sky, 
                        almost like delicate brush strokes. They are made of ice crystals rather 
                        than water droplets because of their high altitude. Cirrus clouds usually 
                        indicate fair weather, but they can also signal that a change in weather is 
                        coming. They drift gracefully across the sky, often glowing beautifully at 
                        sunrise or sunset.</p>

                    <p>Cirrostratus clouds are high, thin, sheet-like clouds that cover the sky and 
                        often create a halo effect around the sun or moon. Made of ice crystals, they 
                        usually indicate that a storm or rain is approaching. Though they can make the 
                        sky appear hazy, they are beautiful to observe, especially when sunlight shines 
                        through their delicate layers.</p>

                    <p>Cirrocumulus clouds are high, small, rippled clouds that look like tiny cotton 
                        balls scattered across the sky. They are made of ice crystals and usually appear 
                        in large groups. These clouds are often a sign of fair but cold weather and can 
                        create a textured, patterned sky that's fun to watch.</p>

                    <p>Nimbostratus clouds are thick, dark, and gray, often covering the entire sky 
                        and bringing continuous rain or snow. Unlike cumulonimbus, they don't produce 
                        storms with lightning, but they can make days feel long and wet. They form when 
                        large amounts of moist air rise and cool evenly, creating a heavy, moisture-laden 
                        cloud layer.</p>

            <h2>Why do clouds look the way they do?</h2>
            <div class="info">
                <h3>Clouds look the way they do because of how they are formed and the conditions in the atmosphere. 
                    Different types of clouds form at different heights and temperatures, which affects their shape, 
                    size, and color. For example, cumulus clouds are puffy and white because they form from warm air 
                    rising and cooling quickly, while stratus clouds are flat and gray because they form from large 
                    masses of air cooling evenly. The amount of water vapor, wind patterns, and temperature also play 
                    a big role in determining how clouds look. So, the next time you see a cloud, you can think about 
                    the weather conditions that created its unique appearance!</h3>

            <div class="info">
                <ul> 
                    <li>Clouds are made of tiny water droplets or ice crystals that are so small they can float in the air.</li>
                    <li>The average cloud weighs about 1.1 million pounds, which is roughly the weight of 100 elephants!</li>
                    <li>There are many different types of clouds, including cumulus, stratus, cirrus, and nimbus, each with its own unique shape and characteristics.</li>
                    <li>Clouds can be found at different altitudes in the sky, from low-level clouds that are just a few hundred feet above the ground to high-level clouds that can be over 20,000 feet up.</li>
                    <li>Some clouds can produce lightning and thunder, which is caused by the buildup of electrical charges within the cloud.</li>
                    <li>Clouds play an important role in regulating the Earth's temperature by reflecting sunlight back into space and trapping heat in the atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>The study of clouds is called meteorology, and scientists use special instruments like weather balloons and satellites to learn more about them.</li>

            <h2>How do clouds form?</h2>
            <div class="info2">
                <h3> 
                    Clouds form when warm, moist air rises and cools in the atmosphere. As the air cools, the water vapor in 
                    it condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals, which come together to create clouds. This process is 
                    often triggered by factors like the sun heating the Earth's surface, causing air to rise, or when air is forced 
                    to rise over mountains or weather fronts. The type of cloud that forms depends on how high the air rises, how much 
                    moisture it contains, and the temperature at different altitudes. So, clouds are essentially made up of countless tiny 
                    droplets or crystals suspended in the sky, creating the beautiful shapes we see above us! <hr> <p>“Next time you look up, see if you can spot a cloud you've never noticed before!”</p>
